# Privacy Policy (GDPR)

## 1. Controller
The controller responsible for data processing within this application is:  
**Jesper Richert**

Since the project is open source, processing is carried out solely within the context of running the software by administrators of each individual installation.<br />
[OPEN SOURCE LICENSE](https://github.com/frank-christiansen/koop-feedback/blob/v2/LICENSE)

---

## 2. Types of Data Processed
The *koop-feedback* application processes exclusively **anonymous or pseudonymous feedback data** voluntarily submitted by users.  
<br />
**No personal data** such as name, email address, or IP address is permanently stored.

---

## 3. Purpose of Data Processing
Data is processed solely for the following purposes:

- Receiving and evaluating anonymous feedback (Only within the private session!)
- Providing the application's functionality  
- Ensuring technical stability and security  

There is **no profiling, tracking, or disclosure of data to third parties**.

---

## 4. Automatic Data Deletion (24 Hours)
All stored data is **automatically deleted after no more than 24 hours**.

Deletion is carried out via an automated **cron job** that removes all feedback entries and temporary data (see the publicly accessible implementation in the open-source repository).

This ensures that no data is stored longer than necessary.

---

## 5. Deletion on Logout
When logging out or exiting the *koop-feedback* app, all temporary local app data is **immediately deleted**.

No information about user behavior is stored.

---

## 6. Security of Processing
The software is provided publicly as an **open-source project**.  
All security-relevant features — including the automatic deletion logic — are publicly accessible and verifiable.

Data is processed only in the form necessary for operation and is technically designed to make personal identification **extremely unlikely**.

---

## 7. Legal Basis
Since only **anonymous data** is processed, the GDPR applies only to a limited extent in accordance with Recital 26.

If personal data could nevertheless be affected, processing is based on **Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest)** — the operation of a privacy-friendly feedback application.

---

## 8. User Rights
If personal data could be involved, users have the following rights:

- Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)  
- Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR) — effectively fulfilled by the automatic 24h deletion  
- Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)  
- Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)  

Due to the anonymity of the data, it is usually **not possible** to assign data to a specific person.  
(This means users can only see their own feedback, and after logout it is deleted.)

---

## 9. Server / Hosting
The application stores data **exclusively on the server** on which it is installed.  
No data is transmitted to external providers unless this is configured separately by the administrator.

---

## 10. Open Source & Transparency
The full source code is **publicly accessible** and can be inspected, modified, and reused by anyone.  
This ensures maximum **transparency**, especially regarding data processing, security mechanisms, and deletion routines.

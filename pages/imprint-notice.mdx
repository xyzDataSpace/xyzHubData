## Disclaimer

### Liability for Content
The contents of this website were created with great care. However, I cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content.  
As a service provider I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with general laws (§ 7 Abs. 1 TMG).  
I am not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity (§§ 8–10 TMG).  
Obligations to remove or block information under general law remain unaffected. Liability is only possible from the moment a specific infringement becomes known. If I become aware of any legal violations, the content will be removed immediately.

### Liability for External Links
This website may contain links to external third-party websites. I have no influence on the content of those websites and therefore cannot assume liability for them.  
The respective provider or operator is always responsible for the content of linked pages.  
At the time of linking, no legal violations were identified.  
Permanent monitoring of linked content is not reasonable without concrete indications. If legal violations become known, such links will be removed immediately.

Content and works created by the website operator are subject to German copyright law.  
Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of use outside copyright limits require written permission.  
Downloads and copies of this site are permitted for private, non-commercial use only.

Upon notification, such content will be removed immediately.

### EU Dispute Resolution

The European Commission provides an Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform:  
<https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr>  
I am not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution procedures before a consumer arbitration board.
